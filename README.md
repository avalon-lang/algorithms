# Quantum algorithms

This folder contains a collection of quantum algorithms.
The explanation of each algorithm here can be found in the documentation.

## Deutsch's algorithm: deutsch

Deutsch's algorithm solves the following problem: given a binary function, find out if 
it is constant (returns the same output for all inputs) or balanced (returns different outputs on different inputs).  
The classical version requires calling the function twice while the quantum version calls the function only once.
